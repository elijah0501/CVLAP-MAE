This repository contains the codebase for the paper Contrastive Video-Language-Audio Pre-training with Masked AutoEncoders for Video Action Recognition.
The complete codebase is currently being organized. To facilitate the review process, key components of the code have been uploaded in the interim. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. The full codebase will be made publicly available upon acceptance and publication of the paper, for the benefit of the research community.
